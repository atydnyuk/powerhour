# powerhour
Want to do a power hour with your buddies, but can't find a good power hour video? Make your own!

Basic instructions:

1. Python 2.7, moviepy 1.0.0
2. `source_video/` directory with 60 videos
3. `transition.avi` -- a short clip ideally around 5-6 seconds long that will play between videos
3. Run `python power_hour_generator.py`

You can configure the video source directory, transition file, etc. with command line arguments. Nothing fancy.
